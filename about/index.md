## Free Python Games


`Free Python Games` is an Apache2 licensed collection of free Python games
intended for education and fun. The games are written in simple Python code and
designed for experimentation and changes. Simplified versions of several
classic arcade games are included.

Python is one of the top-five most popular programming languages in the world
and available for free from `Python.org` Python
includes an extensive Standard Library distributed with your installation. The
Standard Library has a module called Turtle which is a popular way to introduce
programming to kids. Turtle was part of the original Logo programming language
developed by Wally Feurzig and Seymour Papert in 1966. All of the games in
`Free Python Games` are implemented using Python and its Turtle module.

Starting in 2012, `Free Python Games` began as an after school program to
teach programming to inner-city youth. The goal was to have fun as much as it
was to learn. Since then the games have been improved and used in a variety of
settings ranging from classrooms to summer day-camps.

The games run anywhere Python can be installed which includes desktop computers
running Windows, Mac OS, or Linux and older or low-power hardware such as the
Raspberry Pi. Kids across the United States in grades 6th-12th have enjoyed
learning about topics such as encryption and projectile motion through games.

Each game is entirely independent from the others and includes comments along
with a list of exercises to work through with students. Creativity and
flexibility is important. There is no right or wrong way to implement a new
feature or behavior! You never know which games students will engage with best.
